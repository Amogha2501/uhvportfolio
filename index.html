                        The Medical Health Bot is an AI-driven chatbot designed to provide users with instant medical guidance, symptom assessment, and basic health-related information. It acts as a virtual assistant that interacts with users through natural language, helping bridge the gap between patients and healthcare resources—especially in situations where immediate consultation with a healthcare provider is not available.
                        This bot was developed with the goal of increasing accessibility to preliminary healthcare information and reducing unnecessary hospital visits for minor or common symptoms. It is not a replacement for professional diagnosis but rather a supportive tool to help users make informed decisions.

                    This project is a complete UI/UX design prototype for a food catering service, created entirely using Figma. The goal was to conceptualize and design a visually engaging, user-friendly web application interface that allows users to explore menu options, customize catering packages, and submit event bookings. The design emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and responsiveness to provide a seamless experience across different devices.
                    The project includes multiple screens such as:
                    Home Page: A welcoming introduction with featured dishes and navigation.
                    Menu Page: Categorized food sections (e.g., Starters, Main Course, Desserts) with card layouts.
                    Order Page: A flow for selecting items, quantities, and scheduling delivery.
                    Contact/Booking Page: A form for event catering inquiries.
                    All screens were designed with a focus on real-world usability and a clean visual hierarchy, using consistent color themes, typography, and spacing.
